# unity-modular-textures

_README last updated May 21st, 2022_

I wanted to follow along with "Board to Bits Games"' [_Modular Textures in Unity_ youtube tutorial series](https://youtu.be/cIIaKdlZ4Cw). There's no github repo for it, and the tutorial came out in May-June 2016. So, I made this repo for it.

Each pull request corresponds with a video in the 9 part series.
